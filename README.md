**What is the website about** <br>
This is a portfolio website for the sake of showing my work as a Design and HCII student. It is a portfolio website. The website shows the overview of my projects in terms of the duration, team members, advisors and the tools used. It is mainly for the projects that I have. This website is mainly for rescruiters and like-minded people to see my work and my potential and hopefully help get a job. I have used the external library Tilt.js which is fun and cool to use. Furthermore, I hope that my content is interesting for the audience. <br>
<br>
**Using my website**
<li>My website is very intuitive to use
<li>Clicking on the logo "KS" takes you to the landing page which is the projects page
<li>Hovering on the project cards will use the "tilt.js" effect
<li>Click on any of the the cards to take you to the project detail page
<li>Clicking the links navigation bar takes you to the respective pages
<li>The website is minimally responsive, I would work on it later to make it better
<br>
 <br>
**External Libaries**
<li> Tilt.js
 <br>
 I chose to use it for the purpose of adding the elegance to the interaction of clicking on a project card.
 I implemented it by downloading the Tilt.js and j-query libraries and following a tutorial to implement it.
 It adds a playful element to my website.

** Iteration from assignment 7**
 <br>
 <br>
 Unfortunately I was extremely sick during the time of assignment 7. So I had to delay to progress of my website. I did not use p5.js to make a particle system because it was not possible to implement it in the project. Also after doing some research I realised that my project goals were out of my skill level and also too much. What I mean by that is that, better portfolios are usually more effective if they easier to use and quick to navigate through for recruiters, so I made it simpler.
<br>
 <br>
**Difficulties**
<br>
<br>
One big difficulty I faced is to make the website responsive. I tackled it partially by using media queries. The other thing was allignment and structing. This is very important to me as a designer. I spent a lot of time on youtube to understand it better.
